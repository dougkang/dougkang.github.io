          <div class="post-content"><p>In light of the attack that happened during the Boston Marathon, I thought I&#8217;d store away for future reference one of the quotes that has been passed around quite a bit. Mister Rogers, on the advice that his mother gave him when he was young:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, &#8220;Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.&#8221;&#8221; To this day, especially in times of &#8220;disaster,&#8221; I remember my mother’s words and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers – so many caring people in this world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his own words:</p>
<iframe frameborder='0' height='315' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/-LGHtc_D328' width='420'>Your browser does not support iframes</iframe>
<p>An amazing quote from an amazing man. Here are 10 more amazing things I found out about him:</p>

<ol>
<li>He started out in TV because he hated it and thought that it could be used better as an instrument to nurture those who would watch and listen.</li>

<li><em>Every zippered cardigan he wore on Mister Roger&#8217;s Neighborhood was knitted by his mother</em>. A red one is on display in the Smithsonian and a <em>&#8220;Treasure of American History&#8221;</em>.</li>

<li><em>He wrote his own songs</em>.</li>

<li>Mister Rogers was the same off-camera as he was on-camera, stating that <em>&#8220;One of the greatest gifts you can give anybody is the gift of your honest self. I also believe that kids can spot a phony a mile away.&#8221;</em></li>

<li>Mister Rogers <em>never</em> did any commercial endorsements of any kind, though frequently did non-profit endorsements for organizations dedicated to learning.</li>

<li>In 1969, when Nixon threatened to cut a $20 Million proposed budget, Mister Rogers appeared before the US Senate Subcommittee on Communications and delivered a passionate plea and the cut was overturned.</li>

<li>Mister Rogers testimony was considered in the right to record shows in 1979, going against the views of others in the television industry. His reason? <em>Children could record his shows and watch them with their family.</em></li>

<li>He is ranked 35th in TV Guide&#8217;s Greatest TV Stars of All Time.</li>

<li>The traffic light decoration on the show is always on yellow - a reminder to kids and parents to <em>slow down</em>.</li>

<li>Mister Rogers began airing in 1968 and ran for <strong><em>895</em></strong> episodes, with the last set of new episodes being taped in December 2000. Talk about dedication.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#8217;s not often that a man can live a simple life full of integrity and compassion and yet make a huge impact on the a nation.</p>

          <div class="post-content"><p>There has been something I wanted to tinker with for a while now that my coworker thought of and today I finally got around to doing it. I simplified the problem and boiled it down to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Given a 2 week slice of historical stock data (start, high, low, close, volume), can I predict whether or not the stock will turn a profit in the next 1 week?</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seemed simple enough that countless people have probably already thought of and tried something like it. And since every other person is not a millionaire, you could have colored me a bit skeptical that this would actually be viable. Nevertheless, I figured it was an interesting exercise and I thought I&#8217;d make a rough first cut to see if it was worthwhile pursuing.</p>

<p>I approached this as a classification problem, though in hindsight, I probably shouldn&#8217;t have. I figured 1 week is enough time to let the stock &#8220;bake&#8221;, but not enough for me to lose alot of money if things go badly. As such, I concluded that if I could just pick more profitable 1 week windows than nonprofitable ones, on the whole, I would make money. For my data, I took the 10 years of historical data for about 10 semi-randomly chosen stocks and I started tinkering.</p>

<p>Given the (relatively) small dataset, I figured I could probably use an svm to do the classification for me, with the 2 week slice of historical data as my attributes. I kept the stock data seperate, meaning that I used only the stock&#8217;s data to build the svms for that particular stock. Today was just the first cut, so its still very rough. I ran my test set through the svms and then calculated the actual per-share profit for the results: <pre>
[1] "f 0"
[1] "ba -4.92999999999998"
[1] "aapl -15.1319"
[1] "intc -6.1211"
[1] "chk -4.7"
[1] "cmg 50.68"
[1] "gm 3.53000000000001"
[1] "goog 79.7101000000001"
[1] "ko 7.64000000000001"
[1] "mmm 5.16000000000001"
</pre></p>

<p>Not bad, if you ask me. I think it&#8217;s definitely showing some promise. I&#8217;ll tinker with it and get back to you.</p></div>

            &nbsp;
            <span class="post-tagline">and why I ditched Wordpress</span>
          </div>
          <div class="post-date span2">11 Apr 2013</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row-fluid">
          <div class="post-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using Wordpress for a good 6 or 7 years now and I got pretty good at it, making a couple of plugins and full-fledged themes and such, but when it came down to it, Wordpress just wasn&#8217;t cutting it for me, for one main reason: <em>it&#8217;s too darn heavyweight</em>. For a &#8220;simplified&#8221; blogging interface (and I use that term lightly), I had to stand up a db and execute php, all for a site that barely changes weekly? I don&#8217;t need comments, I don&#8217;t need to change themes, I don&#8217;t need roles, I just need <em>blogging</em></p>

<p>So along comes <a href='http://jekyllrb.com'>Jekyll</a>. I found out about it through a company that was working next to us during my earlier startup days. You write in <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'>Markdown</a> in whatever editor you like. You compile your blog like a program and it jekyll spits out the site in plain ol&#8217; html which you can serve however you like. As a backend programmer, <em>this makes sense to me</em>. My site doesn&#8217;t change on even a daily basis - why does my blogging framework need to dynamically create the site more or less on every visit?</p>

<p>I laughed a little to myself though, because as I was just starting to learn how to program, I wrote a similar (albeit much more simplistic) thing in C. I called it Janga (it was a time when <a href='http://www.xanga.com'>Xanga</a> was all the rage). I had a directory with my posts, a header and a footer. I would run my Janga program and it would spit out an html sandwich of the header, all the posts, and the footer, which I would then manually upload to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities'>Geocities</a>. Of course, being only like 12 at the time and just starting out, it was super janky, but it worked and I was happy.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been tinkering around with Jekyll as mentioned before and I think I got a pretty good workflow going on, so I thought I might share it.</p>

<h3 id='a_little_about_my_site'>A little about my site:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>powered by <a href='http://jekyllrb.com'>jekyll</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>using <a href='http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/'>flat-ui</a> for styling</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>three layouts</p>

<ul>
<li>the default, which is the layout for viewing multiple posts or projects</li>

<li>the post, which is the layout for viewing single posts</li>

<li>the project, which is the layout for viewing single projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='now_the_setup'>Now the setup:</h3>

<p>I have my blog as a git repository.</p>

<p>I have a remote git repository on my server that I have set up with a post-receive hook on it that I stole from <a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20091223025644/http://www.taknado.com/en/2009/03/26/deploying-a-jekyll-generated-site/'>here</a>.</p>

<p>I have a script to add that I stole from <a href='http://minhajuddin.com/2010/10/01/helper-script-to-create-new-posts-using-jekyll'>here</a> and modified to automatically add the post to git and open the resulting file in Sublime Text.</p>

<p>I have Sublime Text installed with the <a href='https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview'>Markdown Preview</a> plugin installed. Make sure you have the Live Reload plugin installed as well. The only weird this with this is that Markdown Preview completely barfs when it tries to read your YAML front matter. Oh well.</p>

<p>My workflow looks something like this: <pre>
  $MY_WEBSITE_REPO/tools/add_script.rb
  # This opens up a Sublime Text window with the newly created post opened
  # I bring up Markdown Preview, which brings up a browser which renders the markdown on each save
  # When I'm done writing:
  git commit -m "My new post"
  git push toserver
</pre></p>

<p>Once I push, the post-receive hook kicks in, generates the site and moves it to the appropriate location if the compilation was successful. My site has been updated with my new post. Pretty sweet if you ask me!</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ve seen how easy it is to use plugins but I haven&#8217;t used any yet. I&#8217;ll let you know how that turns out</em></p>

<h3 id='the_not_so_good'>The not so good</h3>

<p>But, here are the not so cool things that I&#8217;ve found:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding images is not so fun. It&#8217;s not as braindead as it was in wordpress.</li>

<li>While the framework is pretty flexible, its still blog oriented, so it&#8217;s limited to blog-like websites.</li>

<li>Migrating my wordpress was a pain. I used <a href='https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp'>exitwp</a>, but there was still alot of manual work that I needed to do and all my image links are broken.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since, I&#8217;ve streamlined my blogging process as much as I can, hopefully that will drive me to write more to this thing. I have a couple of things that I really want to show regarding fantasy basketball that I&#8217;ve been refining over the course of the last season.</p></div>

By default, it uses markdown, which comes naturally to me thanks to github. The workflow for creating posts is more akin to the workflows that I am used to (e.g. writing in plaintext in a console, pushing stuff to git) and the flexibility is pretty amazing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using this as a chance to revive my thrice-dead blog - hopefully I can make it live longer than last time. I&#8217;ve been doing alot of work getting my spark cluster at home working and I find it quite nice, though some things are not quite so nice - again, more on this later.</p>

<p>On a side note, I went to my parent&#8217;s house today and spent time with them.  I&#8217;ve been stressing alot over the interview stuff and the impending layoffs - so much so that it&#8217;s really affecting my personal life.  I just can&#8217;t relax nowadays unless I&#8217;m completely alone.  I feel the most relaxed when I am doing something.  Is it a bad thing?</p>

<p>Along a similar vein, my mom keeps urging me to go to the dentist, as my teeth look terrible, according to her.  And they do, to be honest.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m losing focus here again and the paragraphs keep getting shorter.  I&#8217;m using an application called Finch to time where I&#8217;m spending the most time, at least on my computer.  I&#8217;ll also try to do some kind of daily log to see what I am doing outside of my computer.  Hopefully it can help me to become MORE EFFICIENT.</p>

<p>My brother is leaving for school again tomorrow.  Also, my schooling for the Information Retrieval and Web Analysis class is starting on Monday.</p>

<p>Bleh.  I hate myself.</p></div>
