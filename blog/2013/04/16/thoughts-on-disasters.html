        <p>In light of the attack that happened during the Boston Marathon, I thought I&#8217;d store away for future reference one of the quotes that has been passed around quite a bit. Mister Rogers, on the advice that his mother gave him when he was young:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, &#8220;Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.&#8221;&#8221; To this day, especially in times of &#8220;disaster,&#8221; I remember my mother’s words and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers – so many caring people in this world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his own words:</p>
<iframe frameborder='0' height='315' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/-LGHtc_D328' width='420'>Your browser does not support iframes</iframe>
<p>An amazing quote from an amazing man. Here are 10 more amazing things I found out about him:</p>

<ol>
<li>He started out in TV because he hated it and thought that it could be used better as an instrument to nurture those who would watch and listen.</li>

<li><em>Every zippered cardigan he wore on Mister Roger&#8217;s Neighborhood was knitted by his mother</em>. A red one is on display in the Smithsonian and a <em>&#8220;Treasure of American History&#8221;</em>.</li>

<li><em>He wrote his own songs</em>.</li>

<li>Mister Rogers was the same off-camera as he was on-camera, stating that <em>&#8220;One of the greatest gifts you can give anybody is the gift of your honest self. I also believe that kids can spot a phony a mile away.&#8221;</em></li>

<li>Mister Rogers <em>never</em> did any commercial endorsements of any kind, though frequently did non-profit endorsements for organizations dedicated to learning.</li>

<li>In 1969, when Nixon threatened to cut a $20 Million proposed budget, Mister Rogers appeared before the US Senate Subcommittee on Communications and delivered a passionate plea and the cut was overturned.</li>

<li>Mister Rogers testimony was considered in the right to record shows in 1979, going against the views of others in the television industry. His reason? <em>Children could record his shows and watch them with their family.</em></li>

<li>He is ranked 35th in TV Guide&#8217;s Greatest TV Stars of All Time.</li>

<li>The traffic light decoration on the show is always on yellow - a reminder to kids and parents to <em>slow down</em>.</li>

<li>Mister Rogers began airing in 1968 and ran for <strong><em>895</em></strong> episodes, with the last set of new episodes being taped in December 2000. Talk about dedication.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#8217;s not often that a man can live a simple life full of integrity and compassion and yet make a huge impact on the a nation.</p>
