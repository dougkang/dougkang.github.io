        <p>There has been something I wanted to tinker with for a while now that my coworker thought of and today I finally got around to doing it. I simplified the problem and boiled it down to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Given a 2 week slice of historical stock data (start, high, low, close, volume), can I predict whether or not the stock will turn a profit in the next 1 week?</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seemed simple enough that countless people have probably already thought of and tried something like it. And since every other person is not a millionaire, you could have colored me a bit skeptical that this would actually be viable. Nevertheless, I figured it was an interesting exercise and I thought I&#8217;d make a rough first cut to see if it was worthwhile pursuing.</p>

<p>I approached this as a classification problem, though in hindsight, I probably shouldn&#8217;t have. I figured 1 week is enough time to let the stock &#8220;bake&#8221;, but not enough for me to lose alot of money if things go badly. As such, I concluded that if I could just pick more profitable 1 week windows than nonprofitable ones, on the whole, I would make money. For my data, I took the 10 years of historical data for about 10 semi-randomly chosen stocks and I started tinkering.</p>

<p>Given the (relatively) small dataset, I figured I could probably use an svm to do the classification for me, with the 2 week slice of historical data as my attributes. I kept the stock data seperate, meaning that I used only the stock&#8217;s data to build the svms for that particular stock. Today was just the first cut, so its still very rough. I ran my test set through the svms and then calculated the actual per-share profit for the results: <pre>
[1] "f 0"
[1] "ba -4.92999999999998"
[1] "aapl -15.1319"
[1] "intc -6.1211"
[1] "chk -4.7"
[1] "cmg 50.68"
[1] "gm 3.53000000000001"
[1] "goog 79.7101000000001"
[1] "ko 7.64000000000001"
[1] "mmm 5.16000000000001"
</pre></p>

<p>Not bad, if you ask me. I think it&#8217;s definitely showing some promise. I&#8217;ll tinker with it and get back to you.</p>
