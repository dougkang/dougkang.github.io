        <p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been realizing the lack of discipline I have in just about everything I do, which is weird because I always saw myself as a rather disciplined individual.  I finally shook myself out of denial when I realized that, for every 5 minutes I was trying to read up on learning Erlang, I would switch to a different tab and check my fantasy football team or something else completely random. &#8230; Just now I just switched to a new tab to check what was on Woot! today.  I realized that I just can&#8217;t get myself to focus for more than 5 minutes without getting distracted by something completely and utterly orthogonal to what I am working on.  My last attempt on learning how to learn (I was reading a book called &#8220;Refactoring Your Wetware&#8221;) further fueled my ADD-like behavior by telling that I have to let my subconscious do the work and to take breaks every so often to process what I had just learned.  Somehow, I got it into my head that it&#8217;s good to take breaks and, moreover, it&#8217;s even better to take breaks more often and obviously, this is NOT the right thing to do.</p>

<p>So, in a spur-of-the-moment kind of motivation, I have decided to take steps to make myself more disciplined in a couple areas of my life.  First and foremost, I need to do my daily QTs.  Second, I need to take a disciplined approach to my career.  Finally, I have to take a disciplined approach to my life.  I accomplish these things by doing the following:</p>

<p>1. QT Daily - &#8216;Nuff said. 2. Use a notebook to trap my random tangents so that I can maintain my train of thought.   Basically, I will keep a small notebook by my side at all times and whenever I lose focus because of some random thing, I will write it down. 3. Morning Meditation - 15 minutes minimum 4. Morning and Post-work memory dumps - 3 pages total of WHATEVER COMES TO MY HEAD 5. Wake up and sleep at the same time daily - Times TBD 6. Exercise regularly - Type of Exercise TBD</p>

<p>I know, I know.  The list gets vaguer as the numbers increase.  It shows how much I thought about the later ones.  In any case, I&#8217;ll make things clearer as time goes by and I accomplish the higher entries on the list.  In any case, let&#8217;s do this!</p>

<p>PS: I know that the picture is completely random.  I also know that it made you laugh.</p>
