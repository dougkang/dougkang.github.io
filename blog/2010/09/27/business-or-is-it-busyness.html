        <p>I&#8217;ve been trying to keep myself busy in a number of things in order to take my mind off certain other things.  I realize how much happier I am when there are things to do.  Of course, being incredibly busy is not good either - just enough to get your mind off the little, mundane things.  You know, enough work where you don&#8217;t have time to be proud or arrogant.  Because no matter how important things seem now, some things, in the grander scheme of the world, they just don&#8217;t matter.  There are definitely times where you just have to take a step back, introspect, retrospect, and prospect.  But sometimes - you know, when the crap really hits the fan - you just have to put your head down and work your butt off until the dust settles a bit.</p>

<p>One thing that has definitely been keeping me from losing my mind is this video.  I can just imagine the happiness that this guy is feeling:</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#8217;ve already lost my mind, which is why this video is so awesome to me?</p>
