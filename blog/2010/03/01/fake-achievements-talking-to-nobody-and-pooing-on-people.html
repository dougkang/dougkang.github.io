        <p>Here is an article that I came across that really hit home for me (despite the title, its not anything dirty, trust me):</p>

<p><a href='http://www.petermichaud.com/essays/achievement-porn/'>http://www.petermichaud.com/essays/achievement-porn/</a></p>

<p>2 bullet points directly from the article sum the whole thing up quite nicely:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. Our society is set up to make us feel as though we must always achieve and grow. That’s true because individuals growing tend to bolster the power and creature comforts of the groups they belong to with inventions, innovations, and impressive grandstanding (Go Team!). 2. Because of this pressure to grow, there’s another incentive to make growth _easier_. More perversely, to make growth _seem_ easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Feeling</em> like you achieved something is <strong>not</strong> the same as actually achieving something.  THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH.  Achievements can only be called as such if you work hard for it or there was a good amount of uncertainty and risk involved.  I found that there are many times where I seek that &#8220;achievement high&#8221; without the work.  It can be an addiction, I tell you.</p>

<p>So, I want to make sure I don&#8217;t fall into this addiction.  How?  I&#8217;m gonna work hard and set my sights high.  No more laziness or being satisfied with my current state.  I&#8217;m on a constant road to improvement from here on out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to get back into journaling, twittering, and facebooking lately.  Actually, I&#8217;ve just been trying to  become a more social person overall.  How&#8217;s it going?  Not too good.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that in my hermitude I lost quite a few friends and ever so slightly regret losing them.  Anyways, in posting entries such as these and twittering, I feel like I&#8217;m talking to nobody.  Which is fine, really - most of these thoughts of mine are for myself more than anything.  Though it&#8217;s actually good for me to get these things out of my head and onto some other form of memory, does this mean I&#8217;m crazy?  Crazy people talk to nobody, don&#8217;t they?  And now I&#8217;m asking question to nobody expecting an answer.  Wow, I must be psycho.</p>

<p>On a completely random note, I was walking home from starbucks today and I felt a thud on my sweater.  I looked down to find a huge bird crap on my sweater&#8217;s front pocket.  I looked up to glare at the the culprit to find the pigeon staring straight back at me.  Now I know these birds are quite dumb, but it knew exactly what it was doing when it dropped it&#8217;s steaming green poo/pee on me (you know that birds poo and pee at the same time, right?).  But hell, now that I think about it, if I could fly away from people without getting caught, I&#8217;d dump on them too.  You&#8217;re forgiven, pigeon.</p>
