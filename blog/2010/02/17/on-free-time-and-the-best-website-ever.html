      <div class="row-fluid post-content">
        <p>Right now I&#8217;m having a lot of trouble finding time to work on some personal projects.  I have a couple of things I want to do, but the work never seems to end.  And here I thought my last quarter would be my most relaxing, but it turning out to be quite the opposite.  Compilers is inherently time consuming and EE is definitely not my forte, but this Software Engineering course is surprisingly time consuming.  That, on top of Siminsights work, leave me exhausted at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I wonder if I&#8217;m really using my time efficiently?  To find this out, I&#8217;m going to track my schedule for the next week to see where my time is really going.</p>

<p>On a side note, I was browsing through Proggit and I came across <strong>THE BEST WEBSITE EVER</strong>.  Simply put, it&#8217;s a pastebin where you can put in and share code with your friends.  What makes it <strong>UTTERLY AWESOME</strong> is that you can <strong>COMPILE, DEBUG,</strong>and <strong>RUN</strong> the code!  I haven&#8217;t fully tested its capabilities yet, but so far it has blown my mind.  Oh and did I mention that it does all of that in 40 different languages?  The only flaw is that if you are using such a service, you probably don&#8217;t have any friends to share the code with anyways, which defeats the whole purpose.  I kid, of course; We CS people are surprisingly quite sociable.</p>

<p>Online Mini IDE and Debugger: (<a href='http://www.ideone.com/'>www.ideone.com</a>)</p>

<p>On a totally random note, I find myself typing &#8216;mysql&#8217; instead of &#8216;myself&#8217;.  It just happened twice in the previous sentence.  Does this happen to anyone else?</p>

<p>Back to friends, it DOES go against good programming sense to have friends.  In fact, in a recent lecture on class design, our professor stated in all seriousness to &#8220;avoid friends&#8221;.  Only I laughed, which was kind of troubling.</p>

<p>On a final note, I hope I get to participate in the SC2 beta.</p>
