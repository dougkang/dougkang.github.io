<p>Today is a sad day in that I lost a companion in my programming journey. After almost 8 years, my Logitech S510 Keyboard Mouse Combo finally typed its last letter this morning. I tried changing the batteries and adjusting the wireless receiver to no avail, it was dead.  Over the years, I had grown quite fond of that keyboard.  With it&#8217;s sudden passing, I  realized that things simply won&#8217;t be the same without my trusty S510 Keyboard Mouse Combo at my fingertips. Something about the familiar auditory and tactile response made this keyboard special - I feel almost as if I had lost a long time pet. I started my programming career with this keyboard and now it&#8217;s time to move on.</p>

<p>Since this morning, I have been researching and browsing around for a new keyboard, going to multiple electronics and computer stores to find one that would best suit my needs.  I finally settled on my old keyboard&#8217;s descendant, the Logitech S520 Keyboard Mouse Combo. I hoped that I would be able to find some sort of familiarity in these keys, but alas, they are foreign to me. No longer are the keys smoothed out from my constant keypresses. The familiar sound and feel when I press down on a key are gone and the only solace I have is that the keys are in the same positions as they were.</p>

<p>You might be wondering, what is the big deal with keyboards and why is this guy acting like a psycho? Since music is a major hobby of mine and a large portion of my life revolves around music, I like to consider programming to be very much like playing a musical instrument. One needs to practice daily to remain proficient and up to date on the latest technologies. It&#8217;s a skill that not many people have and it comes more naturally to some than others. And with your instrument you can create something that the world can enjoy. And just as musicians have a kind of attachment to their instrument, I feel like I have an attachment to my instrument, the keyboard (not so much the mouse). As such, it is sad to see my instrument stop functioning.</p>

<p>And now, to my new instrument, may we make beautiful music together in the next 8 or so years.</p>
