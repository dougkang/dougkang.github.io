        <p>Man watching 90s Saturday Morning cartoon opening themes brings backs memories. I don&#8217;t remember studying every day during my K-12 years, but watching TV afterschool was definitely a daily ritual. On another note, lately I have been writing alot of my code in Javascript, so here are a couple of links that helped me shake the rust off my JS skills and learn a new thing or two in the process:</p>

<p>First of all, the book Learning Javascript by Shelley Powers was a nice, short and sweet overview of the Javascript.  The first couple of chapters really brought me back up to speed on Javascript.  I also heard Javascript: The Good Parts is a really good book as well, but I don&#8217;t have access to it, so oh well.</p>

<p>Also, for cross-browser compatibility and a taste of OOP, we are using the prototypejs framework (<a href='http://www.prototypejs.org'>link</a>).  It almost gives a Ruby-esque feel to Javascript, which is pretty convenient at times.  The quickest way to learn prototypejs is through this tutorial: <a href='http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/painless-javascript-prototype/'>http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/painless-javascript-prototype</a>/.  It really goes through alot of the useful methods that make Javascript almost not suck as hard.  On top of this, we are using HTML5 canvas tag to display everything.  Another useful tutorial is here: <a href='http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html'>http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html</a>.  What never fails to amaze me is the quick development cycles that one is able to accomplish with a scripting language such as Javascript.  Sure, with extremely large projects, you might end up losing more than you gain because of the high complexity, but at that point, you might want to start looking into having a standalone app rather than a web app.</p>

<p>With the whole HTML5 + javascript vs Flash war going on, it&#8217;s interesting to see the projects that are being developed on the Javascript side of the battlefield.  One of the killer apps coming up is smokescreen (<a href='http://smokescreen.us/'>link</a>) which apparently programatically translates flash into javascript and html5.  From what I&#8217;ve seen, this shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult, since they both are implementations of similar standards.  The jury&#8217;s still out on who will prevail, but to put my opinion out there, my lunch is on HTML5.</p>

<p>Since last Thursday, I&#8217;ve been in Los Angeles and, in all honesty, it&#8217;s good to be back.  Granted, I wasn&#8217;t able to be as sociable as I would have liked to be (a long story, but basically I left my keys back at home, so I had to wait around for Bernard, my roommate to let me in), but life is so much more exciting here.  It took me about 40 minutes to find parking today, but hey, it&#8217;s a small price to pay for a social life.  I really missed the spontaneous McDonald&#8217;s/Boba runs and random outings.  Those were some things that I just couldn&#8217;t do in San Jose, since my friends simply lived too far away for any form of spontaneity.  I think that was the thing I missed most and, like I said before, it&#8217;s good to be back.</p>
