<p>Today was my last day working with SimInsights, a small startup that I had the honor of working for the past year. It was hard work and the hours were a bit odd, but I must say that most of it didn&#8217;t feel like work at all. When I tell people about what I&#8217;ve been doing the past year, they inevitably ask how much I got paid and when I tell them I did a majority of it for free, well, let&#8217;s just say that I&#8217;ve seen my fair share of jaws dropping. Even my parents were a bit skeptical about the whole thing, preferring that I go traveling (&#8220;but with whose money?&#8221; I ask and the conversation usually ends there).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I am satisfied, because I feel like I&#8217;ve gained things far more important that money and tourist experiences. I learned how to handle myself professionally and efficiently collaborate with people worldwide (Thanks, Kedar). Just working with real code and solving real problems has increased my programming and software engineering competency tenfold. Most importantly, I was able to dip my toes into the interesting world of entrepreneurship. Also, throughout the whole experience, my boss(es) built up a very positive, nurturing, and efficient work environment that promoted creativity and constantly challenged me and pushed me to new heights. Even pulling all-nighters for the sake of the team was almost (yes, almost) enjoyable. Overall, I feel like I have matured greatly as a professional and a person through Rajesh&#8217;s guidance. And hey, to top it all off, I met a couple of people who I can solemnly call my friends.</p>

<p>So to Rajesh and Kedar, thanks for the good times, thanks for being patient with me, and thanks for being overall awesome people. The best of luck to both of you and I really do sincerely hope that our paths will continue to cross in the future.</p>

<p>For people who are interested, SimInsights is a company dedicated to making simulation software more readily available to students. I probably fudged it up there, so I think I should stop before I hurt myself and just post the link right here: <a href='http://www.siminsights.com'>www.siminsights.com</a>.</p>

<p>With that, I can no longer distract myself from what is ahead any longer.  As my starting day for Yahoo! draws near, I can&#8217;t help but wonder if I am up to snuff.  And so it ends and begins.</p>
