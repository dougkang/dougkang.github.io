<p>So over the weekend, I played an intense game of Risk with my friends.  Though it wasn&#8217;t the longest game of Risk I have ever played, it was quite the epic battle lasting for about 5 hours.  The weak quickly fell away and 3 of us toughed it out, making and breaking alliances, one of us always getting to the verge of being eliminated, but coming back in the end.</p>

<p>On the drive home, I began to think about the advantages of attacking or defending. In the end, I became curious enough that I wrote a program that calculated the probabilities of various numbers of die.  In case you are unfamiliar with the rules of Risk, you can roll up to 3 die as an attacker and up to 2 die as a defender.  Each players pair up the top two values.  For each pair, the player with the lower value loses one unit.  On the event of a tie, the attacker loses.  So without further ado, here are the probablities for each possible outcome.  Note that this is in the perspective of a defender.  A Win means that only the attacker lost units, a Loss means that only the defender lost units, and a tie means both players lost units:</p>

<p>Attacker/Defender Win % Tie % Loss %</p>

<p>3/2</p>

<ol>
<li>0</li>

<li>1</li>

<li>9</li>
</ol>

<p>3/1 36.5 X 63.5</p>

<p>2/2</p>

<ol>
<li>8</li>

<li>4</li>

<li>8</li>
</ol>

<p>2/1 42.1 X 57.9</p>

<p>1/2 74.5 X 25.5</p>

<p>1/1 58.7 X 41.7</p>

<p>The numbers are far from surprising.  The best situation for an attacker is to use 3 die to the defender&#8217;s 1 dice and the best situation for a defender is to use 2 die to the attacker&#8217;s 1 dice.  Interestingly enough, for a 3 die attacker vs a 2 die defender, the average loss rate is about the same (1.011 to 0.989 units lost per roll). In order to maintain the 3 die advantage, it becomes necessary to have at least 4 more attackers than defenders.  For the defender, it is advantageous to have only 1 more defender than the attacker (in order to always roll 2 die).</p>

<p>Good things to know to make playing Risk less risky.</p>
