<p>So today I got in the mail, my very own Nintendo.  No no, not a Wii, but the original NES.  In an action driven by pure nostalgia, I decided that I will make it my hobby to collect games for the NES.  None of the crappy ones, though.  I remember going to my church friend&#8217;s house (his name was Michael) just to play Double Dragon on the NES.  My first exposure to a video game console.  Those were the days, huh?  Remember when you had to blow on the cartridges to get them to work?  Back then, I thought those graphics were the ish and here we are in the HD world.</p>

<p>So the NES came with one game - Mario Brothers.  Yeah baby,  this is as OG as it can get.  The console itself has a new 72 pin connector installed, so the game plays with no blowing required.  A couple more games are on the way, namely Ninja Gaiden and Double Dragon (how could I not?).</p>

<p>The first video game console I ever owned was a Super Nintendo.  My dad brought it home after going on a business trip to Oregon.  Man was that the happiest day of my life!  Opening it up and playing Super Mario World for the first time.  And when I beat Bowser for the first time, we literally had a party to celebrate.  Since then, I&#8217;ve had just about every Nintendo console/handheld created, with the exception of the NES (which I now have) and VirtualBoy (but that thing was a load of crap anyways, so no thanks).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been very nostalgic lately, thinking about the good old days when life was simpler&#8230; You have to admit, even though technology is simplifying our lives, it&#8217;s still pretty darn complicated.</p>
