<p>Lately, there has been this facebook virus going around and it really grinds my gears to see people fall for the same trick every single time. Once in a while is fine, I guess - OK, you made a mistake, you didn&#8217;t know. But in this day and age, you think people would learn? So, I will state what you need to know clearly in three sentences:</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a free lunch. Never take candy from strangers. Don&#8217;t trust your &#8220;friends&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now before you get your panties all in a bunch saying that I&#8217;m asking you to become a loner/hermit like me, hear me out.  Do you know for a fact that johndoe@gmail.com that sent you the email &#8220;Hey here is a cool picture of me and you, click on this shady link to view it.  Oh and to make sure it&#8217;s you, type in your name and your social security number&#8221; is actually John Doe, your friend?  If the style of writing doesn&#8217;t match or something is fishy, just ask your friend to confirm that the link is OK.  Friends won&#8217;t let friends get viruses, right?  And I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t die if you don&#8217;t see the pictures of his new puppy RIGHT NOW.</p>

<p>No matter how bad you want to watch that new show or watch the NBA live over the internet, don&#8217;t trust strange websites, especially anything that requires you to download a program or install an extension or plugin in order to view.  Nowadays, everything you need to do things in your browser like viewing pictures, videos, etc. is already installed in your browser (with the exception of Flash and Java).  I pity the fool who thinks he needs to install extra software to watch a video.</p>

<p>Be wary of sites with lots of popups and sites that require you to take certain steps to view (Vote for us on this page, then click this link, then type in your name and social secur&#8230; wait what?)  Oh and another thing: <strong>Don&#8217;t trust sites just because you found it on Google and Google says it&#8217;s clean</strong>.  Never download anything unless you know exactly what it is.  Even then, run it through a virus scan software, or <a href='http://virusscan.jotti.org/en'>jotti</a>.  Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<p><strong>Strongly consider paying for antivirus software</strong>.  You get what you pay for most of the time and what you&#8217;re paying for is peace of mind and safety from future headaches.  Don&#8217;t think just because you have a mac, you are safe either: <a href='http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/'>http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/</a>.  This person decided that he would find a vulnerability in OSX every day of the month for one month and succeeded.</p>

<p>Another thing, people and websites are not as benevolent as you think.  Servers cost money to maintain, so unless you are visiting some .edu, .gov or (occasionally) a .org site, <strong>if it&#8217;s free you are most likely paying it in some other way</strong>.  If you aren&#8217;t paying for the service in cash, you are paying for it by viewing their ads or worse, downloading a trojan or virus that will share your private information.  In the end, there are people running these websites and they need to eat.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>stop downloading pirated software/media</strong>.  It all comes back to the &#8220;there is no free lunch&#8221; thing.  A good deal of viruses I&#8217;ve dealt with would not have been a problem had the owner of the computer just did the right thing.  People worked hard to make the thing you are now essentially stealing.  You want to be paid for the three hours of hell you went through babysitting those horribly bratty kids, right?  Just the same, pay money where money is deserved.</p>

<p>On a final note, don&#8217;t get offended.  Take this advice or leave it.</p>
