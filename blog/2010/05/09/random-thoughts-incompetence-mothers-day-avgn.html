        <p>One of my new year&#8217;s resolutions was to always leave relationships on a good note.  As my dad would always say, &#8220;never burn the bridges that you worked so hard to create&#8221; (I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s actually a pretty well known quote, but I heard it first from my dad).  It&#8217;s not about building a network really, but just building friendships and relationships.  I realized that it is not in my current capacity to KIT (I remember people scribbling that in my yearbook but never really meaning it).  It&#8217;s really hard, especially when the person-to-be-kept-in-touch is physically a long way aways.  But you know what, some friendships are worth it and I am really going to make an effort to keep in touch with those people that I really think would be good friends, no matter the distance.</p>

<p>The guest speaker at our church today spoke of how socially stupid people in Silicon Valley are and I agree.  We are sometimes too smart for our own good and as a result, we isolate ourselves and never learn what it means to build relationships.  I even see myself seeing friendships as a problem that needs to be solved and analyzed rather than a relationship to be nurtured and developed (these are obviously not my words, as I am not nearly as eloquent).  I think I can go as far as to say that prideful people cannot build meaningful relationships.  And so, I&#8217;ll be the humblest guy that I can be because I want to be your friend.</p>

<p>I realized also that there are many times where Hannah and I fought and the gist of it came down to one person or the other not feeling loved.  What is Hannah&#8217;s love language?  I have to figure that out and stop being so damn selfish!  Every time I mess up, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m too selfish and I only think about myself.</p>

<p>So today was Mother&#8217;s Day and a couple of the church people and I put together a video for the occasion.  My mom loves it so much that she has been playing it for the past 30 minutes nonstop and laughing every time.  I have to say, it was a good experience, but man was it hard to get 40 people to do one thing.  Overall, it didn&#8217;t come out too bad:</p>

<p>What did I learn from this whole experience?  Never assume anything, especially when it comes to people.  It turned out that the people I thought would require the least reminding, ended up requiring the most reminding and vice versa.  Give lesser, non-critical parts to the people that you are most dubious about.  I know this initially sounds bad, but as they do their part, you will build up your trust in those people and in turn, they will receive more critical roles.  Always appear optimistic and cheerful - know in your heart and mind that the project will succeed.   It really hurts morale when the leader of a project seems dubious or pessimistic about the project.  Give hard deadlines, but allow late submissions.  One of the last submissions for the video came in at 12PM the day of (I usually have to leave for church at 1230PM to get to church on time).  Her clip made the entire video two times better than it would have been.  I guess these should have been bullet points, but who is gonna read this anyways?</p>

<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of the Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN).  Man, that guy is funny.  This guy basically reviews these old, crappy video games as a pissed off nerd - comedy gold.  What makes it good though is that his passion for movies and video games really shows through his videos.  People really pick up on that and, as a result, he has quite a loyal following now (heck, I&#8217;m a fan for sure).  If you&#8217;re curious, you can check out his website at: <a href='http://cinemassacre.com'>http://www.cinemassacre.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> what&#8217;s the deal with youtube/facebook like/dislike?  Man, it takes like no energy to do and therefore it&#8217;s meaningless.</p>
