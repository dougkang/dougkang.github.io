<p>I&#8217;ve made it out alive from a week of orientation.  In case you were wondering, I started at Yahoo! this past Monday and boy are there interesting and exciting things in store for Yahoo!  The past week was a New College Graduate orientation in which we got to meet the other new college graduates and some of the key people in this organization.  The HR people treated us like babies the entire way and it was a bit annoying, but I guess that is what they think of us and who are we to say otherwise (we&#8217;re babies, of course)?  Although for the most part I was dying of boredom (as were the other people in the orientation), there were a couple sessions that were quite interesting.</p>

<p>First, David Filo, the cofounder of Yahoo! stopped by and had a Q&amp;A session.  While Jerry Yang was the more business brains, he was the tech brains behind it all and it was interesting to see the way that he thought about certain things.  One thing he was able to do as a result was to not have to fuss about the business side of things and just focus on creating the right technology to put Yahoo where it is today.  Though he is obviously not in the spotlight, he was and still is the backbone of this organization.  Mad props to you, David Filo.  I hope to one day become like you in that aspect.</p>

<p>The other thing that happened was the advertising head &#8220;something&#8221; Figueroa came in and talked about the current state of advertising and where Yahoo is headed.  Though I probably cannot say much as to where we are headed, I must say that I came away quite impressed and excited for the things to come.</p>

<p>Finally, Irving came in and talked about the products, but more importantly, what made him come out of retirement to join a company that, to the general public, looks like a second rate internet company (relative to Google of course).  His reasons were pretty inspiring and I can see that the company is in good hands with this guy around.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things that I observed were common among many of the leadership bunch so I thought it might be of some worth to write them down.  You may disagree about these things and hey, you&#8217;re probably right.  But if you&#8217;re complaining, go read someone else&#8217;s blog or write another blog saying how wrong I am.  In short, tough luck:</p>

<p>1. They were knowledgeable and passionate in the domain in which they were leading 2. They have clear goals and visions and were confident in the direction that they were leading the organization 3. Their goals and visions are able to stand even when under scrutiny 4. They are able to instill their passions in others 5. They care for the little guy 6. They just <strong>make sense</strong></p>

<p>One thing that the HR kept emphasizing was that, &#8220;you are not employees but &#8216;Yahoos&#8217; because you are special.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>Sorry I threw up a little in my mouth for a second there.  Anyways, for some reason I kept thinking about the Yahoos from <em>Gulliver&#8217;s Travels</em>.  If you aren&#8217;t sure what I&#8217;m talking about, in one Gulliver&#8217;s later travels, he travels to a world in which horses are the civilized beings and humans (called Yahoos) were uncivilized, hairy beasts that were rude, uncouth, and a nuisance at best.  As you can probably imagine, I couldn&#8217;t help but sneak a smile every time they mentioned Yahoos the whole week.</p>
