      <div class="row-fluid post-content">
        <p>I&#8217;ve moved from writing in my journal to typing in my blog mainly due to the fact that is less work to type my ideas down than to write them on paper.  I know that the Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning book mentioned that the process of writing it helps with the thought process, but you know what?  Fuck that.  There are alot of thoughts in my head and I&#8217;ve noticed that I usually get a cramp before I even finish writing my thoughts and end up missing most of them.</p>

<p>In any case, most of my thoughts are on the impending layoffs.  With Yahoo not doing so well, it&#8217;s just a matter of time before I get laid off.  It&#8217;s a bit disconcerting to know this, but you know what?  Life moves on.  The thing that I am most worried about is not being able to find an equivalent job.  What I loved about this job were the people that are a part of my team and the learning that I am doing and I continue to do.  One thing I quickly realized though was that I don&#8217;t think I have to type of intelligence to continue down this path - I need to find myself in either a project management or entrepreneurial position.  I am not even sure if I might be good at those things, to be honest.  A question I find myself asking is, &#8220;Am I really smart?  Do I have what it takes to succeed in this industry?  What are my skills?  What are my strengths?&#8221;</p>

<p>One thing I definitely find myself lacking in is my ability to memorize.  I don&#8217;t remember having such a bad memory, but lately, I have been realizing that I am no longer in the habit of memorizing things.  The mentality I had (which I now need to change) is that, if it&#8217;s easily accessible, don&#8217;t memorize it.  Now I find myself constantly referring back to API references, not even being able to recall numbers that I had read seconds earlier.  This needs to change.  This lazy mentality is not a good thing.  Instead, my new mentality will be, <strong>MEMORIZE IT SO THAT IT&#8217;S EVEN EASIER TO ACCESS</strong>.</p>

<p>This brings me to my next point, which is the lazy habits that I have built up recently.  Watching Youtube, lazing around, sleeping overall way too much - these things all need to stop, starting with Youtube and Hulu.  I just cancelled my subscription to Hulu - I wish there was a way to limit the amount of Youtube I am watching&#8230; alas, the curse of the Internet.  Now that I think about it though, it all started when I started my Hulu subscription.  I need another change in mentality.  While before I was thinking that I worked enough, I deserve a break, I want to engrain the following mentalities in my head, <strong>YOU CAN NEVER WORK TOO HARD</strong> and <strong>THE IDEAL THING TO DO IS SOMETHING THAT IS BOTH FUN AND PRODUCTIVE</strong> and finally: <strong>JUSTIFY EVERY ACTION, SPEND EVERY MINUTE WISELY</strong>.</p>

<p>Another thing I want to do is keep track of all the links that I found interesting.</p>

<p>I want to restart my NBA data visualization project again.</p>

<p>Exercise both your mind and body.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;m done writing for the day.</p>

<p>Wait, one more thing: I need to learn to network better.</p>
