        <p>I was looking at google reader and an interesting article came up: http://sridattalabs.com/2012/03/31/how-I-learned-to-stop-worrying/.  This made me realize that I have really fallen behind with technology and my desire to start my own company.  This guy seems to be about the same age, perhaps even younger than me and he seems to have his act together, already getting alot of experience in back-end frameworks and concepts, even before graduating.  This makes me sad.  I need to get my act together and make up for it with a focused attitude and a motivation and drive like no other.</p>

<p>On a side note, I went to my parent&#8217;s house today and spent time with them.  I&#8217;ve been stressing alot over the interview stuff and the impending layoffs - so much so that it&#8217;s really affecting my personal life.  I just can&#8217;t relax nowadays unless I&#8217;m completely alone.  I feel the most relaxed when I am doing something.  Is it a bad thing?</p>

<p>Along a similar vein, my mom keeps urging me to go to the dentist, as my teeth look terrible, according to her.  And they do, to be honest.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m losing focus here again and the paragraphs keep getting shorter.  I&#8217;m using an application called Finch to time where I&#8217;m spending the most time, at least on my computer.  I&#8217;ll also try to do some kind of daily log to see what I am doing outside of my computer.  Hopefully it can help me to become MORE EFFICIENT.</p>

<p>My brother is leaving for school again tomorrow.  Also, my schooling for the Information Retrieval and Web Analysis class is starting on Monday.</p>

<p>Bleh.  I hate myself.</p>
